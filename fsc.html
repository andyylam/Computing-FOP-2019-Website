                            As an incoming freshman in the year 2018, the School
                            of Computing’s Freshmen Social Camp (FSC) was the
                            first orientation camp I attended, and it set the
                            standard for the subsequent orientation camps, be it
                            from my faculty or from my residential college. Even
                            as a freshman in FSC, the amount of effort put into
                            the planning and execution exhibited by the OGLs and
                            committee was visible for all to see. Naturally,
                            this translated into an exceedingly enjoyable camp
                            of 4 days, which left me excited to be a part of FSC
                            2019.

                            FSC is the best camp that computing has to offer!
                            The experiences I’ve got out of FSC is priceless.
                            It’s a place where you can really let your hair
                            loose and have real fun without being burdened by
                            administrative stuff. It’s the one-stop place to
                            make friends, get important tips from seniors and
                            really just have an enjoyable time! Start your
                            university life right. Start it with FSC!

                            Signing up for FSC was one of the best choices I
                            have made during summer. The activities were
                            enjoyable and well conducted, allowing us freshies
                            to foster new friendships amidst the fun and games.
                            The friends I’ve made and the memorable camp
                            experience will definitely stay with me for a long

                            I wasn’t expecting much when I signed up for this
                            camp but it actually turned out to be one of the
                            best camps I’ve ever had. I am extremely grateful to
                            have great orientation group leaders who guided my
                            orientation group and ensured that we had fun
                            throughout the game. It was through this camp that i
                            managed to meet many new friends and some of them
                            ever became one of my closest group of friends I
                            have in University!
